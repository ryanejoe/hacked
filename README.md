																																		welcome!
_**intro**_: glyched, is a toolset which contains many use full tools(only a few have been added so far)

_**tools**_: file encrytion using fernet,port scanner, sherlock, mass-emailer, mac-changer, network scanner, arp spoofer

_**_note- sherlock is not made by me, my program simply installs it and makes it easier to use_**

**language**__: python

_**libraries required**_: _cryptography, socket, sys, os, datetime, smptplib, csv, subprocess, colorama, email, pyfiglet,scapy,time

                                                 **TOOLS**
**file encryption:** it uses fernet to encrypt a text/csv/document and produce a key, it makes it so that the encrypted  file cannot be decrypted without the filekey

**port scanner:** does what the name says! it scans a network for open ports

****sherlock:**** it is a tool which will scan all social media platforms to search for a specifed username, works well for targets using the same name on multiple social meida platforms

****bulk emailer***: send a simple email to all emails listed in  csv file using smtplib

****mac changer:**** spoofs your mac address, makes it harder to trace your device

****network scanner:**** will scan a network and return all devices connected to the network(ipv4 adresses and MAC adresses)
personal tips:

****ARP SPOOF:*** will send packets to both, target and router saying that our machine is the target to the router and that our machine is the router to the target, this makes it so that all traffic that the target and router are sending to eachother goes through the attacker, NOTE: this ony makes the attacker a man in the middle, for seeing traffic use a 3rd party packet sniffer(NEW SNIFFER COMMING SOON





****if the program doesnt run, then try installing all the required dependancies****

****UPCOMMING: PACKET SNIFFER(ment to be used with the arp spoofer)****
